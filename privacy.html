<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p>Last updated: 2025‑08‑18</p>
<p>This Policy describes how the App handles data.</p>
<ol>
<li><b>Data the App processes.</b> OAuth tokens from TikTok (access/refresh), video files you choose locally, and metadata (titles, schedule times). Tokens are stored locally on your machine.</li>
<li><b>No analytics / no sharing.</b> The App does not send your data to third parties except TikTok APIs to perform uploads.</li>
<li><b>Retention.</b> Tokens and settings remain on your device until you delete them. Videos are read from your chosen folder; the App does not keep copies after upload.</li>
<li><b>Security.</b> Keep your machine and TikTok credentials secure. Revoke tokens in TikTok if compromised.</li>
<li><b>Your rights.</b> Since data stays locally, removal is done by deleting local files/settings and revoking tokens.</li>
<li><b>Contact.</b> [your email].</li>
</ol>
